{{< anchor "1" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Who are the participants in the real estate and construction value system?

How are firms organized individually to deliver and own projects?

How are they collectively organized to deliver projects?

How does the physical product flow through this supply chain? How does the money flow?

Where do you think are the major areas of economic reward? Of risk?

How are firms individually organized to contain risk and to receive reward?

Where are there inefficiencies in the system?

How is the whole value system optimized for best performance, if at all?

Steps in Planning

Industry Value System - Risk and Reward

{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}
Poland's A2 Motorway,  Harvard Business School Note 9-202-030.
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}
No written assignment. Prepare to discuss the case in class, including incorporating your judgment of the issues and considering key concepts from the reading.
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

{{< anchor "2" >}}{{< /anchor >}}*Notes*

This is a finance case about one project which we will use to illustrate cash flow and risk allocation issues. Students are not expected to bring sophisticated financial analysis to the discussion at this time.

*Questions*

What is the arrangement of this value system?

Follow the money. In broad terms, how is the money supposed to flow if the project is successful?

In broad terms, who is responsible for what?

What are the major risks? How are they described? How well are they understood?

Who do you think stands to reap the most reward? Who takes the most risk?

Could you define "success" for the whole project including all organizations involved?

As leader of one of the organizations, how would you go about planning to be the Owner?The Engineer? The General Contractor?

Do you think that the alliance could continue as an operating business on other projects?

Market Segmentation: How to Analyze?
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}
Young Canada Dock Builders, The University of Western Ontario, Richard Ivey School of Business Note 9A89-J004.
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

Consider your options as John Morrison, the CEO of Young Canada.

In particular, prepare a market segmentation matrix using the concepts in Chapter 7 of the reading.

Consider your choices in how to set it up. What does Young Canada sell to whom? What could they sell to whom?

Discuss how this analysis informs your efforts in answering the questions in the case. For example, what insights to you gain about the individual cells in your segmentation diagram? What else would you like to know?

Segmentation matrices and other diagrams for this problem set may be hand drawn. I am looking for thinking, not for computer formatting skills.

{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

{{< anchor "3" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Consider the 8 steps in planning. How would you answer the questions with respect to Young Canada (not for the written assignment).

In what segments might Young Canada compete?

What are the pros and cons of each segment?

What other steps would the CEO have to take in order to succeed in various segments?

What would the resource allocation in the Firm Value Chain look like for the various possible strategies?

How much should he spend on marketing?

What would you do?

Segment Attractiveness: Where to Compete?

Generic Strategies

{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}
SOHO China, Harvard Business School Note 9-703-011.
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

Consider your options as a principal of SOHO China.

Prepare a market segmentation matrix using the concepts in Chapter 7 of the reading.

What does SOHO China sell to whom? What could they sell to whom?

Using the **Five Forces** model from Chapter 1, discuss how some of these segments might or might not be attractive for SOHO from a strategic point of view.

Then select up to four different segments and describe how the **Generic Strategies** discussed in Chapter 2 might apply to competing in these segments.

All of the diagrams for this problem set may be hand drawn. I am looking for thinking, not for computer formatting skills.

You might also think of other clever ways to efficiently convey the information by combining or modifying some of the tools.

{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

{{< anchor "5" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Arborite is a supplier to contractors. They have a complex firm value chain and many problems in their business. This is the kind of situation that you might be asked to analyze or even to manage!

Where does Arborite fit in the industry value chain? How does Arborite compete: What generic strategies is Arborite pursuing NOW in each segment?

What strategies are their competitors pursuing?

Do the sales goals generally make sense in light of history and total market size?

What would you do about plant capacity?

Are there other opportunities that may not be evident in the case?

In what ways does KONE believe Monospace to be differentiated? Is this realistic? Do the customers care?

How does KONE signal differentiation?

How much will the customers value differentiation, if at all?

How would you manage the rollout in Germany? Why?

What are the firm value chain drivers of a differentiation strategy, in this situation? Should the emphasis be different in the future than presently?

What would you recommend they do?

What are the benefits of vertical integration? The pitfalls? How has Welsh addressed these issues?

{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

{{< anchor "7" >}}{{< /anchor >}}*Notes*

This is a finance case which we will use to discuss vertical integration in the A/E/C value system.

20 years later, what is different and what is the same in our industry?

*Questions*

Think of this case from Willy Welsh's perspective.

Think of this case in terms of the business, Engineered Concepts.

Based on what you can infer from the case, think of the analysis in terms of how you might help this company grow beyond the one project in Savannah.

What role(s) does Engineered Concepts play in the overall value system?

What do you think the firm value chain looks like in Engineered Concepts?

What are the major elements of risk in the Savannah West deal?

Who takes what risks? Who gets what benefits?How could the risks be contained and the rewards be allocated?

What advantages and disadvantages does Welsh realize from being vertically integrated?

How sound is his personal financial statement?

If you were Allison Porter, would you make the loan?

If you were Willy Welsh's Chief Operating Officer, how would you proceed in helping the company to grow and compete?

Would you go to other markets or develop other kinds of projects or play other roles in the value system?

Do you see other opportunities to use these kinds of strategies in real estate, architecture, and construction?

Is "Industry Transformation" possible in our industry? What or who might drive it?

How do you think the advent of Otisline impacts the employees?

Strategy, Leadership, and Choices
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}
Del Webb, Inc., Harvard Business School Note 9-497-016.
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

Phil Dion has quit and you are the new CEO of Del Webb Inc. at the time of the case. Prepare a strategic plan for the business going forward.

What are your major three or four recommendations and why?

Select and use the tools introduced in the course to help make your argument. Also consider the new issues in leadership raised by the case.

{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

{{< anchor "9" >}}{{< /anchor >}}*Notes*

While this case is written to be largely about boardroom dynamics, we will spend more time on looking at opportunities for the firm going forward.

What roles does [Del Webb Inc.](http://www.delwebb.com/) play in the Industry Value System? Does this answer depend on some kind of market segmentation assumption?

How would you articulate Del Webb Inc's market segmentation choices? In what ways would you determine which segments were the most attractive?

What would their firm value chain (or chains) look like to see your strategy implemented?

The company has subsequently gone in another direction following its 2002 acquisition by [Pulte Homes](http://www.pulte.com/): Was this inevitable? Is this the best that could have happened given Dion's options at the time of the case?
